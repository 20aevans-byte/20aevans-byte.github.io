    <p>I’ve always been drawn to how technology shapes the world around us, but it was learning to code that turned that curiosity into a passion for Computer Science. The ability to solve problems through logic, creativity, and innovation is what excites me most about the subject. I’m particularly interested in artificial intelligence and software development, as they combine technical skill with real-world impact—whether it's building smart systems or developing tools people use every day.</p>
    <p>Beyond the classroom, I’ve worked on independent coding projects that challenged me to learn new languages, debug complex issues, and think like a developer. I enjoy exploring how things work beneath the surface, from how search algorithms operate to how encryption keeps our data secure. What sets me apart is my willingness to dive deep into problems, experiment beyond the syllabus, and constantly look for ways to improve and expand my knowledge.</p>
    <p>My goal is to study Computer Science at university and eventually pursue a career in software engineering or AI research. I’m excited by the fast-paced, ever-evolving nature of the field and eager to be part of shaping its future.
